# EventMaps

An Opensource alternative to Meetup.com for bored people :p but through more visually centric approach of Maps. Built using 
React-Leaflet/ReactJS and Redux.

The project is still on progress and will be made Opensource
in few days.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Frontend developer based out of india and have a 
special liking for maps and the geospatial domain which
ultimately led me to work on this project. Hope this work
serves you well in finding any events happening near you
on a mundane saturday evening. Cheers.


## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome for this project although you'd have to wait
a bit more time for this to be made Opensource. Please stay tuned!



## Documentation

Currently on the Process of creating a raw Documentation.


## Roadmap

These are few of the issues/improvements which I'd love to implement
in upcoming versions of this project.

- API integrations with giants of this domain like meetup.com
- To add checks to prevent adding events in inaccessabile locations like seas
- Prevent spam bots from adding locations using scripts
 ...

This list will be updated further with time.
